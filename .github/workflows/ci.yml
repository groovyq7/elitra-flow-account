        # That script verifies the SDK version and all patch patterns after applying them.
        # If any patch fails to apply or the SDK version doesn't match, the script calls
        # process.exit(1), which fails this step immediately. No separate verification
        # step is needed — a passing npm ci guarantees all patches applied correctly.
